Hi Navin Sir,

You are doing a great job by sharing your knowledge and teaching us these awesome things in such an easy and clear way.
You are one of the best online tutors in YouTube. I have seen many playlists of your channel like Git, Rest Api, Hibernate, Maven, etc.
Whatever u teach, I practice it simultaneously. This has helped me a lot. I am basically from Software Testing background.
But because of you, I have learned and will learn a lot of technologies that will help me in my IT journey.
For this, I would like to thank you and wish you good health and all the success in life. 

public class ThankYou
{
  public static void main(string[] args)
  {
    Alien rakesh = new Alien();
    rakesh.thanks();
  }
}

public class Alien
{
  public void thanks()
  {
    system.out.println("Thank You Navin Sir");
  }
}
