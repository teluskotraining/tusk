Roasted Makhana Recipe

Step 1:  Take a pan, add 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil to it and heat it. Once the oil is hot add the makhanas to it.
Step 2: Roast the makhanas for 10-12 minutes on a low flame, and keep stirring in between, till they become light golden brown and crisp.
Step 3: Once roasted, you can add some salt or chaat masala to it and store it in a jar once it cools down.
Step 4: To roast makhana in the microwave, take some makhanas in a microwave-safe bowl and heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave.
Step 5: After 30 seconds, take them out of the microwave, give them a good stir and keep it back in for 30 seconds again. Keep repeating this process until the makhanas are crispy and roasted.
