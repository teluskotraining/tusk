Pressure cook the dal with tomatoes, turmeric, salt and 3 cups water till completely cooked through and can be mashed easily between two fingers. If using a traditional pressure cooker, cook for 4-5 whistles. In an Instant Pot, cook on manual for 30 minutes. Use a wire whisk or spoon to mash the dal further so it's almost smooth.
Heat ghee and butter in a pan and add the smashed garlic. Stir fry on high for a minute till the garlic is fragrant and starts turning golden brown. Reduce the heat and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, green and red chillies and stir fry for another minute.
Add red chilli powder and give it a quick stir and all the cooked dal along with 1/2 cup water. Bring this to a boil and simmer for five minutes.
Switch off the flame and stir in chopped coriander and lime juice (if using). Serve hot with rice, pickle, sliced onions and rotis.
