A biryani from Hyderabad is like its people, exciting, spicy, sweet and tangy – all in one!  Pieces of marinated mutton, long grain basmati rice and fragrant whole spices layered and cooked together on low heat till the meat is tender and falls of the bone and the rice has fluffed up and is soft.  Fried onions or barista, kewra water and saffron strands added to this brings along plenty more aroma and flavour! Sunday brunch or house party – this biryani is fit for any occasion!
