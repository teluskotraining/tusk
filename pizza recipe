One of the basic tips is to make sure that you have preheated the oven. In case you are using a standard oven then make sure it’s preheated at 280 degree Celsius.
In case you are using a readymade base, make sure it’s not cold. Make sure that you take it out half an hour before you start making the pizza.
Don’t roll the dough, stretch it to make the base. This means if you are making the fresh pizza base, the dough will be at room temperature and it would be easy to stretch it.
The best way to make restaurant-style pizza is to use a pizza stone, as it helps the dough in rising and makes it crisp as well. Go for it.
If you want to use an organic approach in your pizza, then you can use the fresh tomato puree or paste. This will make your pizza more delicious.
