Recipe from Shiva
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)
2 teaspoons sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 can (14 oz) of pizza sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions)
Instructions:
Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until foamy.

Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms.

Knead the dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.

Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.

Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.

Shape the dough: Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.

Top the pizza: Place the dough circles on a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and your desired toppings.

Bake the pizza: Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.

Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza!
