    Pick and wash the rice and the dal, and soak together in water for 1/2 an hour, at least. Drain and keep aside.
Heat the ghee in a heavy based saucepan and add the cumin and heeng.
When the seeds splutter, add the rice and dal mixture, and saute over high heat, till well mixed and excess water dries up.
Add the dhania powder and the salt and mix well too. Add 2 1/4 cups water, and bring to a boil, covered.
Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, by which time the khichdi should be cooked, and ready to serve.
