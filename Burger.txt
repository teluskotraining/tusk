Recipe from RajdeepDey101

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add kfc chicken and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. ...
Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

Thanks.
