Spread crust with barbecue sauce. 
Top with bell pepper and onion, bacon, chicken, and cheese. 
Bake about 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken is warm and cheese is melted.
You'll find pre-made pizza crusts in the refrigerated section of most supermarkets, 
which makes this an easy recipe for casual entertaining.
