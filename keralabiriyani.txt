**Kerala Chicken Biryani Recipe-Mufil Rahman**

**Ingredients:**

For the Rice:
- 2 cups Basmati rice
- 4 cups water
- 1 bay leaf
- 4-5 cloves
- 4-5 green cardamom pods
- 1-inch cinnamon stick
- Salt to taste

For the Chicken Marinade:
- 1 kg chicken, cut into pieces
- 1 cup yogurt
- 1 tablespoon ginger paste
- 1 tablespoon garlic paste
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 2 teaspoons red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste

For the Biryani:
- 3 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2 green chilies, slit
- 1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
- 1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves
- 1/2 cup fried onions (for garnishing)
- 1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
- Saffron strands soaked in warm milk
- Fried cashews and raisins (for garnishing)

**Instructions:**

1. **Marinating the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to create a marinade.
   - Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is even better).

2. **Preparing the Rice:**
   - Wash the Basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear.
   - In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
   - Add the washed rice, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and salt.
   - Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (the grains should still have a bite to them). Drain and set aside.

3. **Assembling the Biryani:**
   - In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the ghee and vegetable oil.
   - Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown.
   - Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.
   - Add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes are softened.

4. **Layering the Biryani:**
   - Place a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom of the pot.
   - Sprinkle some mint and coriander leaves on top.
   - Add a layer of partially cooked rice.
   - Sprinkle fried onions, garam masala powder, and some saffron milk.

5. **Repeat the Layering:**
   - Create another layer with the remaining chicken, mint, coriander leaves, and rice.
   - Top with fried onions, garam masala, and saffron milk again.

6. **Cooking the Biryani:**
   - Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can also seal the lid with dough to ensure no steam escapes.
   - Place the pot on a tava (griddle) over low heat. This ensures even cooking and prevents burning.
   - Cook for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice and chicken to cook through.

7. **Final Garnishing:**
   - Once the biryani is cooked, remove it from heat and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
   - Before serving, garnish with fried cashews, raisins, and the remaining mint and coriander leaves.

8. **Serving:**
   - Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers.
   - Serve the Kerala Chicken Biryani hot with raita, pickle, and papad.
