Remove the melted chocolate from the stove and add the sweetened condensed milk and the 2 tbsp. of butter.
Keep stirring as you add the contents so the chocolate is melted and smooth. 
If the chocolate is too thick, splash with whole milk. If the chocolate is not sweet enough, splash with condensed milk.
