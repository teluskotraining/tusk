Take a pan and place it on the stove.
add required amount of oil to it and heat it for 10 min.
Now add the potato slices to the pan and heat them until the potatoes are fried (they look light yellow brown).
Seperate the oil from the potatoes.
add them to a bowl and add some red chilli powder to the potatoes.

That's it.. Your fry is ready :) 

Thanks Navin sir for such a good video on GIT.
