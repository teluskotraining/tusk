Easy chicken fry recipe: a simple and basic recipe for making chicken 
fry using cubed boneless chicken pieces and spices. There are probably
thousands of different variations to an easy chicken fry recipe including
what you can add to the marinade, the quantity of spices, whether you use
pepper powder or not, etc.
While I love the chicken 65 recipe which we tend to default to quite often,
this easy chicken fry is a close second. You can make the basic spice paste
in advance to marinate the chicken and leave it overnight in the refrigerate. 
You can also freeze the marinated chicken for up to two weeks but itâ€™s best
to fry it after a few hours.
A good chicken fry is like a balm to the non-vegetarian soul. Very few things 
can be as comforting an addition to some rice and dal. I recommend making a very
simple onion salad as a side to this because raw onions go really well with
the spices added to this dish.
