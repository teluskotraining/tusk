Recipe of IRANI-CHAI  by REVANTHNETHA

INGREDIENTS:
3 cups water
1 1/2 tbsp black tea powder
3 cardamom pods optional but recommended
1 1/2 cup milk
2-3 heaped tbsp condensed milk
Sugar as needed

PROCEDURE:

In a saucepan, add the water, tea powder and cardamom pods. Bring to boil. Close the pan with a tight lid and keep something heavy on top. Keep on simmer and cook for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in another saucepan, boil the milk. Keep on low flame, stirring occasionally to avoid sticking, till the milk thickens and reduces to almost half - around 15 minutes.
Add the condensed milk and cook for another five minutes.
Once the thick tea concoction is done, strain the mixture and add to the thickened milk. Bring to a boil and switch off.
Sweeten as per desire, and divide into cups. Serve immediately.
