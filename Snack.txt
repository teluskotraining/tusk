                            A recipe to boil potatoes.

Boiled potatoes are an excellent source of energy,thanks to their rich starch content.
I have started eating them more, after tiring coding sessions, recently.
Okay! Let's move onto the recipe part now....

Take 3-4  medium sized potatoes and wash them with water to remove any dirt.
You can either choose to boil them in a cooker or you can take a bowl.
Cut the potatoes into pieces, not so smaller, and put them in a bowl.
Pour enough water into the bowl to submerge all the pieces. If you use a pressure cooker, a glass of water would do.
Add sufficient salt, proptionate to the water in the bowl or you can salt the pieces after cooking, which I won't recommend.
Let the potatoes boil for 25 minutes, approximately. If it's a cooker, 3-4 whistles would be enough.
Pour the hot water in the bowl out and fill it with normal water to cool the potatoes a bit faster.
Let them cool for a while and then peel the pieces off with care.
Those who didn't add salt before can do it now. Or you can try having them with mango pickle, which was so good when I tried recently.
Relish the dish.
