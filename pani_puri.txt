Pani puri, as I call this awesome snack has always been a favorite since childhood. I remember me and my folks having pani poori from the pani puri wallah on the streets of Mumbai many a times.

I have even seen how the puris are made in bulk and then sold. while as a kid, I used to think, how come the puri puffs so much and stays crisp. There was a family, close to my house who used to make these puris in bulk, pack them and then supply them to grocery stores.
