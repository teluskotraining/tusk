First off, the fresh pasta dough itself is a breeze to make.  
If you happen to own a food processor, the dough can be prepped in less than 5 minutes.  (Or you can make it by hand or in a stand mixer in less than 15 minutes.)  
The process of rolling out the noodles is also easier than I expected, especially once I got the hang of using my little pasta maker.  (I’ve included instructions below as well for how to roll out pasta using a stand mixer or a rolling pin by hand.)  
I’ve also enjoyed experimenting with the various different pasta flours and discovering which ones I like best for different occasions. 
(Short answer — I prefer “00” flour most of the time, but occasionally mix it with semolina for heartier shapes or sauces.) 
Mostly, though, we’ve just enjoyed eating fresh pasta. 
It has such a delicious, fresh, chewy, unmistakable bite to it.  And it has instantly kicked some of our favorite pasta recipes up a mega notch.  (Here’s lookin’ at you, cacio e pepe!)
