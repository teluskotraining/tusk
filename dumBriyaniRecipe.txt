Hi Sir,

I don't know how to prepare Pizza, I love Briyani a lot. So thought of giving my DumBriyani Receipe.

Ingredients,

1.Briyani leaf, clove, cinnamon stick, cardomen ==> All for smell of the briyani
2. Ginger-garlic paste
3. ghee
4.curd 
5. Big Onion
6. Mint leaf
7. Cashews(Optional)
8.Basmathi Rice or Normal Rice
9.Chicken or Vegetables like carrot,beans,potato, green peas
10. Salt and Chilly Powder

Method:

Dip the Bamathi Rice in water and leave it for half an hour.After start preparing the briyani

Pour Oil and add all smell giving list which I mentioned above. Add the chopped Big Onion and ginger-garlic paste and mix it well.

Add required salt and Chilly Powder. Add a cup of Curd or grained Mint leaf. 
Then add Chicken or the veggies which you liked. Leave it for 5 mins. Then add the Basmati Rice and add water. 
If 2 glass of rice taken then 1 glass of water is enough as Basmati rice doesn't need much water and its easy cooked with less water.


Am not a great cook sir, so Didn't mention the quantity of each ingredients. 


Hope you like,
Stay Safe sir,
