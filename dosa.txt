Dosa also called as dosai (in Tamil language) is a famous South Indian breakfast or snack both in India as well as outside India. 

Dosa are basically rice and lentil crepes which are made with ground and fermented lentil-rice batter.

The lentils and rice are soaked for 4 to 5 hours. They are then ground separately to a fine consistency. Both the lentil batter and the rice batter are mixed with salt. 

The batter is then allowed to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.

After the batter is fermented, the batter is poured on seasoned cast-iron pan or skillet (tawa) and spread like a pancake and cooked till crispy and golden.
