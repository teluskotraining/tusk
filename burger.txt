Take two burger buns
Grill two chicken patties 
Generously apply some mayonaise above some leaves after adding tomatoes and onion.
Place the patties once they are fully grilled
Put a double layer of cheese on its top and close the burger bun on top
Serve it with some sauce.

First time, kindly excuse if not found tasty :)

Thank You
