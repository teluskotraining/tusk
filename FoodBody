"What you call as 'my body' is just an accumulation of the food you eat. So, what kind of food you eat should depend not on your values and ethics or on what you think about it, but on what your body wants. Food is about the body. If you are aware enough, if you just touch a piece of food, you will know how this food would behave in your system."
