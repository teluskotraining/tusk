Recipe by Samir

In a medium bowl, combine ground chicken with finely chopped radish, green onions, onions, garlic, ginger, ghee, spices, salt. If you are brave or have someone brave enough, taste and adjust the mo:mo spices.

Slowly mix in and add water to help mix the ingredients. You don't want mo:mo mix to be too watery.

Let it rest for few minutes or longer.

In the meanwhile, prepare the dough for the wrapper (or have mo:mo wrappers ready) and mo:mo achar.

Fill a steamer with water and grease the steamer basket with oil, oil spray or line it with parchment paper, lettuce or cabbage leaves.

Take about 1-1/5 teaspoon of mo:mo filling and place it on a mo:mo wrapper and fold them to your desired shape. You may need more or less depending on the shape of the wrapper.

Steam for 8-10 minutes (or longer if your wrapper is thick and large in size) and gently shake the steamer basket and transfer it directly into your plate.

Enjoy it hot with tomato achar.
